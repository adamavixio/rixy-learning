# Steps

1. You need to initialize this project with npm and also create a tsconfig.json file for it to compile. You will need to globally install ts-node to run it.
    - Before you start complaining, remember that React, Svelte, and everything else does this and you need to know it.
2. Solve all of the problems in api.ts. They do not need to be perfect or the most efficient. Just get the right answer.
3. Make sure you import the api.json file (you will need ts-node), and the first function returns the data. Try to console.log it.
4. This is going to be the base of learning React.
