// You will need to import the api.json file here

interface Data {

// Make sure you type what is returned from this function
// Do not let it auto type for this exercise

// Call functions like this to use them while developing your API

// For all questions below, you will have to call fetchData
//
//

// Write a function that finds a user by an ID and returns the user
// Return -1 if the user is not found (hint look for javascript functions that do this for you)

// Write a function that finds a person by name (lowercase or uppercase) and returns the user

// Write a function that gives a list of all deleted todos
// You MUST use map here

// Write a function that gives a list of all todos that are not done
// You MUST use filter here

// Write a function that returns all users that start with the name before "p" alphabetically

// Write a function that returns all todos that are done AND deleted

// Return a new list of todos that does not modify the original array, and marks them all as done (true).
// Like this [{text: "text", done: false}, ...]

// Modify the returned todos to only give a list with "text" and "done" fields
// Like this [{text: "text", done: false}, ...]
